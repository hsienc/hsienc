Hi, this is Eric Hsienchen Chu. I am a junior undergraduate student majoring in Economics and Mathematics at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. While I am still exploring different possibilities, my current research interests are International Trade and Industrial Organization. Outside of school, I ride with [Team Brazen Dropouts](https://www.brazendropouts.org/).
