Hi, this is Eric Hsienchen Chu. I am a undergraduate student at [UW-Madison Economics](https://econ.wisc.edu/). I serve as Editor-in-Chief at *[Equilibrium: The Undergraduate Journal of Economics](https://equilibriumecon.wisc.edu/)*, and my primary research interests are Microeconomic Theory with search/monitoring mechanism and Labor Economics with education. Outside of school works, I am a student representative at Economics Inclusion Board and a cyclist at Wisconsin Cycling Club/Team.
