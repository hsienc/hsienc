Hi, this is Eric Hsienchen Chu. I am a junior undergraduate student majoring in Economics and Mathematics at [the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). While I am still exploring different possibilities, my current research interests are International Econ (Trade and Finance), Industrial Organization, and Applied Microeconomics. Outside of school, I ride with Team Brazen Dropouts.
